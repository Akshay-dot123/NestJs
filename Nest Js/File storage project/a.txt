The affectHistory value in the existing code for SQS1 and SQS2 is determined as follows:

0 → when SYNC_EXT_ACTION is null or empty

1 → when SYNC_EXT_ACTION is SALESTEAM_CHG_ALL

2 → when SYNC_EXT_ACTION is SALESTEAM_CHG_CRM

All of the above values are extracted from the NG_SYNC_PRO table.

For SQS1, sqsmessage will be sent for every record, regardless of whether the affectHistory values are the same or different.
For SQS2, only a single sqsmessage will be sent for Records with same affectHistory value. Note that the UUID will be the same for all records sharing the same affectHistory.
For example, if the 'company' table has multiple records with affectHistory values of 0, 1, or 2, then:
Three unique UUID's will be generated where all records with affectHistory = 0 will have same UUID, all records with affectHistory = 1 will share the same UUID, all records with affectHistory = 2 will share the same UUID.
